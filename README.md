# ASL Alphabet Recognition Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets using a machine learning model. The system captures hand landmarks using MediaPipe, processes them, and classifies them into ASL alphabets in real-time.

## Features
- ASL Alphabet Detection: Recognizes ASL alphabets (A-Z) using hand landmarks
- Real-Time Prediction: Leverages webcam input for real-time recognition
- Customizable Model: Built with Scikit-learn, allowing easy experimentation
- Lightweight Framework: Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking and landmark extraction
